## (short) Machine Learning Zoo
* Self Organizing Maps (SOM):
    * Key Features: Topology-Preserving, Unsupervised, Neuro-Inspired (Sensory Cortex, Central Excitation vs Lateral Inhibition), Auto #Cluster Determination
    * Arch-Type: NN (2-layer)
    * Short Idea: using standard NN training scheme to learn a set (usually 2-D and can be N-D) of neurons that preserve the spatial relation. Each active neuron will be a cluster center

## Glossary
* Topology: geometric properties or spatial relation or arrangement/order that will not be changed by (continuous) deformation of the subject.

# Resources for Deep Reinforcement Learning
My main research interest lies in reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning. 
I believe that perfect combination of the two can raise the autonomy of machine to a much higher level. M
y attention is not limited on the hard-core machine learning side but also in its implication in the brain or how inspiration can one get from biological brains on the other way around. 
Last but not the least, possible applications to technology of this line of research are also very exciting. 
In this repo, I will get all those ideas organized and share relevant information (e.g. papers, tech reports, news...) hope to form a very comprehensive but coherent roadmap showing what my research focus will be in the future.
(2020.03.16 Updated) Those not relevant directly to RL will be moved to misc.md file for succinctness.
